# Day-10-of-Learning-Java
In the day 10 I have learn about the topic STREAM &amp; SERIALIZATION &amp; DESERIALIZATION and made the program based on {ByteStreamToUpper , CharacterStreamReplaceSpace ,  EmployeeSerialization using Employees.txt file , Employees.txt file &amp; Deserialization it }.

The problems are as following:-

Q1. Demonstrate a Java program with the class name ByteStreamToUpper to read a file using byte streams and write its content to another file after converting all lowercase 
    letters to uppercase.
    
Q2. Write a Java program with the class name CharacterStreamReplaceSpace that reads a text file using character streams and writes the content to another file after 
    replacing every space character with a hyphen (-).
    
Q3. Create a Java program with the class name EmployeeSerialization that performs the following steps:
    i. Define a class named Employee that implements the Serializable interface.
    ii. Include two instance variables: empId (int) and empName (String).
    iii. Create a parameterized constructor in the Employee class to initialize both fields.
    iv. In the main method of EmployeeSerialization, create two Employee objects with sample data.
    v. Serialize both objects and save them to a file named "employees.txt" using ObjectOutputStream.
    vi. Display a success message once the serialization is complete.
    
Q4. Follow the above program no-03.From this “employees.txt” file access those attribute value use Deserialization .
